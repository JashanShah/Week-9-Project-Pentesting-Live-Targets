# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: (SQLi) SQL injection

Description: For Week 8: Globitek Targets blue target, there is an unsanitized input in the url. I used a sleep command injection.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking and Fixation

Description: Utilizing the session id tool, I was able to fix/hijack the users session and get the same authority and priviliges as the user.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: (XSS) Cross-Site Scripting

Description: An XSS attack can occur due to the feedback form. This is a javascript alert.

![fourth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74270386/163068734-41b8d331-fde0-4ea4-93b1-de5cd347ffa1.gif)


Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration

Description: When the username is invalid, the error is not bolded however when the username is valid, the error is bolded. This makes is so that only the password needs to be cracked as it confirms that the username is correct.


![third](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74270386/163067420-7d0ef4f0-17bb-4556-9a53-4ddda27650f1.gif)


## Red

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Description:

Vulnerability #2: (IDOR) Insecure Direct Object Reference

Description: In the URL it can be seen that there is a parameter called id. Using this information we can tell that there could be an IDOR vulnerability. This is true as seen below.

![red](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74270386/163073100-94fa6e38-702a-4ba7-b9d2-01fc53f87b39.gif)
